# Local folder

The local folder(on the root folder of the repository ./.local) can be used\
to store temporal data, like logs, cache and other stuff.\

## Logs

Logs SHOULD be stored in "./.local/logs/YYYY/MM/DD.txt"\

The logs must indicate the date where an item was logged.\

It's recommended to delete logs monthly.\

# Local data

Local data on './.local/local_data.json' MAY overwrite statements in\
'./settings.json'.\
